# Resources dedicated to Computational Neuroscience
A curated list of resources related to grad school, including how to get in and how to do research. Many resources focus on how to get into CS programs but the general advice they give are applicable to other fields. This list will be extended to computational neuroscience resources, including stuff related to machine learning and signal processing.
